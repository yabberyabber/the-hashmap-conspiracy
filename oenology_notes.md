# Harvest

 - de-stemming & crushing
 - skin contact
 - free run and press run
 - must correction
 - cooling & temperature control

## De-stemming and crushing

 - stems have lots of tennins
 - some wineries have a machine that does both de-stemming and crushing while other wineries have a machine that does de-stemming and another machine that does crushing.  why was there a whole slide on that?
 - White wine is no seed, no skin, no stem
   - often the skin has bitterness in it so we try to make pressing quick
 - Oxidation happens as soon as the grapes are crushed
   - Oxidation makes the wine brown (polyphenol oxidase (PPO) turns brown in the presence of O2)
   - Keeping temperature low (10C = 50F) helps prevent some browning
   - Add sulfer dioxide to slow browning (anti-bicrobial and anti-oxidant)
 - Red wine is de-stemmed and crushed and fermented together
   - Transfer the chunks and juice to fermentation tank quickly so it doesn't oxidate
   - Blush wine isn't fermented on the skin but the skin is heated with the juice so the juice gets skin-color

## Skin Contact

 - White wines have little skin contact
 - Red wines have lots of skin contact
 - seeds and stems have tannins which usually bring acids

## Free run vs Press run

 - When you crush the grapes, there's two types of juice you get from it
 - Free run: juice that flows freely from the just pressed grapes
 - PRess run: Juice that clings to the grape body and requires active pressing to be gotten from the grape corpses
